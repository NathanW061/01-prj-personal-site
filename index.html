      Hello there!<br/>
      I'm a student attending University of Texas at Dallas and am going for a B.S. in Computer Science degree. I am a programming enthusiast 
      and I enjoy experimenting with code outside of class. Until I can land an actual programming job, I bag groceries, push carts, and ring up
      customers at my local H.E.B. to save up for the future.

      <h3>C# (Programming language)</h3>
      <p>
        Out of all of the programming languages I've used, C# is my favorite. Its syntax is similar to Java and C++, but there's more keywords that makes it easier to write readable code (e.g. readonly, is, ref). In the last few years, they've also added some new performance features like ref structs and Spans which are fun to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm familiar with the most of C#'s features, but still do occasionally learn about an obscure feature I hadn't needed yet. Regardless, this is the language I'm most familiar with and I'd say that this would be the language I'd be most productive using.

      <h3>Python (Programming language)</h3>
      <p>
        While I don't find myself using it very often these days, Python has always been a nice language to write scripts for automating certain tasks. The usage of english words and indentation in place of symbols makes it very easy to write readable code. It also makes it easy to write code in one file and reuse that code in another, which is helpful for writing utility functions that I can reuse across multiple scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't used the more advanced features of Python such as classes and the vast amount of third-party libraries, so my knowledge is limited to the simple aspects of the language. That said, I've found Python's an easy language to learn and its documentation is very comprehensive so I'm confident in my ability to write good code in this language.

    <section id="documentation">
      <h3>Code documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Over time writing C# code, I've built a habit of adding documentation tags (and to a lesser extent, standard comments) to my code. While thus far, a large majority of my code has only been seen by me, I like to think that documenting my code will be a useful habit once I begin collaborating with other programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always found it helpful for Visual Studio to display a description for types, methods, parameters, and other defined C# symbols since it reduces the time I would spend looking up what its purpose is, and I'd like for other people who use my code to have that same privilege.
